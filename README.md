# Linear_Algebra-TDA

The code is based on this post http://outlace.com/TDApart2.html, we used this code to graph the simplical complex using images from MNIST Dataset.
To calculate the homology we used ripser: https://ripser.scikit-tda.org/en/latest/

#To run the code
1. Install all the python libraries with the pip command
2. run the program using python example.py
